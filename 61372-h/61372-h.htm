<span class="i0">It was on Easter Monday, in ’Seventy-six,</span>
<span class="i0">In Freemantle the jailers were all in a fix,</span>
<span class="i0">From Fauntleroy,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> down to Amen-timbertoe,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There was racing and chasing and bother, you know,</span>
<span class="i0">For the Fenians had sliddered<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
                 right off in a row;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! Wilson and Cranston and Hogan are gone,</span>
<span class="i0">With Darragh and Hassett and staunch Harrington;</span>
<span class="i0">For Collins and Johnston have opened the ball,</span>
<span class="i0">And to join in the dancing, out step Jones and Hall,</span>
<span class="i0">And they tripped to a tune that was far from being slow;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cops,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
                 warders and soldiers are running a race</span>
<span class="i0">And the mounted policemen prepare to give chase;</span>
<span class="i0">In the pensioner’s barracks the trumpet did blow,</span>
<span class="i0">And old Finnerty’s<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
                 bugle was purple, I know;</span>
<span class="i0">But the boys know their road, and are bound for to go;</span>
<span class="i0">So what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There are two trotting teams on the Rockingham road,</span>
<span class="i0">From the gloom of a prison each bearing its load,</span>
<span class="i0">And full hearts are beating with freedom and joy,</span>
<span class="i0">As they sweep ’round the sand hills and through the Blackboy.</span>
<span class="i0">With the sunlight of Hope every face is aglow;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On, on through the bush, as they ride to the beach,</span>
<span class="i0">In vain for his captives may Robinson<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
                 screech,</span>

                 may swagger to cover his fears</span>
<span class="i0">As they drag out the guns of the Perth volunteers;</span>
<span class="i0">But the Fenians are off; they may puff, pant and blow;</span>
<span class="i0">For what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Near Rockingham jetty, upon the white sand,</span>
<span class="i0">With revolvers and rifles the Fenians stand—</span>
<span class="i0">Gay, fearless and free, stepping into their boat;</span>
<span class="i0">Shove her off! then out oars! on the waters afloat!</span>
<span class="i0">Now a right saucy Yankee tar takes them in tow;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Silvee and Toby and Mopsa give way,</span>
<span class="i0">For the good ship <i>Catalpa</i> lies out in the bay.</span>
<span class="i0">“Come down, you big Louis,” the captain did roar,</span>
<span class="i0">“Now what do you say, men? pull off from the shore;</span>
<span class="i0">You Lombar, keep stroke; pull, men, cheerily, oh!”</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now past Garden Island, and clear off the Sound,</span>
<span class="i0">Make sail on the boat, pass the liquor around;</span>
<span class="i0">Shift your seats, trim the boat, as she bends to the breeze,</span>
<span class="i0">And light as a sea-gull skims over the seas;</span>
<span class="i0">There’s a rest from the oar, while the fair breezes blow;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At six in the evening we sighted the bark,</span>
<span class="i0">And we steered on her track till the evening grew dark,</span>
<span class="i0">When a squall coming down, with its venomous blast,</span>
<span class="i0">Almost swamped our good boat, as it tore out her mast;</span>
<span class="i0">So all night on the billows we tossed to and fro;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next morning at seven we raised her again,</span>
<span class="i0">Topsails, mainsails and hull—we were nearing her plain,</span>
<span class="i0">When we spied the <i>Georgette</i>, steaming out of the Sound,</span>
<span class="i0">And we knew by her course for the bark she was bound;</span>
<span class="i0">So we hauled down our sail, then lay to and lay low;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the <i>Georgette</i> passed by bearing down on our ship;</span>
<span class="i0">All safe for the present—now, boys, let her rip;</span>
<span class="i0">Then we pulled in her wake for to see what she’d do,</span>
<span class="i0">And beside the <i>Catalpa</i> we saw her heave to,</span>
<span class="i0">And lay alongside her ten minutes or so;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">See the <i>Georgette</i> steams off, and is running inshore;</span>
<span class="i0">Make sail on the boat, out with paddle and oar;</span>
<span class="i0">For with every sail set, on her course down the bay,</span>
<span class="i0">The good ship <i>Catalpa</i> is bearing away.</span>
<span class="i0">To gain on her now we’ve a hard row to hoe;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To follow our bark we were pulling amain,</span>
<span class="i0">When we saw the <i>Georgette</i> coming for us again.</span>
<span class="i0">In search of our boat she was steaming right back,</span>
<span class="i0">And we almost despaired as we lay in her track;</span>
<span class="i0">So we hauled down our sail and again we lay low;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still nearer and nearer the steamer came on,</span>
<span class="i0">And our plan of escape seemed all shattered and gone;</span>
<span class="i0">Hope faded away to a very small speck,</span>
<span class="i0">As we saw her lookout and the men on her deck;</span>
<span class="i0">But she passed us unseen—Fate had ordered it so;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the steamer passed on, and was soon out of sight;</span>
<span class="i0">Boys, now for the bark, we must catch her ere night;</span>
<span class="i0">Every stroke is for freedom—pull fast, and pull strong—</span>
<span class="i0">Pull, fellows, together and send her along;</span>
<span class="i0">See the bark change her course, heading for us I trow;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was two in the evening, and everything clear,</span>
<span class="i0">The bark coming to us, and nothing to fear,</span>
<span class="i0">When a sail on our lee, standing out from the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Set us pulling our strongest with paddle and oar;</span>
<span class="i0">It’s a race for the ship, men; then row, bullies, row!</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With the sail on our lee, heading on for the ship,</span>
<span class="i0">We pulled strong and steady, and gave her the slip;</span>
<span class="i0">For beside the <i>Catalpa</i> we tossed oars at three,</span>
<span class="i0">With the water-police boat close up on her lee.</span>
<span class="i0">Quick on deck now, my lads! It was just “touch and go;”</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hoist the star-spangled banner, the flag of the free!</span>
<span class="i0">The brightest and best that waves over the sea:</span>
<span class="i0">May its stars ever brighten, its shadow increase,</span>
<span class="i0">Then a fig for John Bull and his water-police.</span>
<span class="i0">Wear ship! then for sea, blow you fair breezes, blow!</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here’s a health to brave Anthony, pass it along,</span>
<span class="i0">May his fortune be great, and his name live in song;</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s to Smith, our first-mate, fill your glasses with glee,</span>
<span class="i0">For a right manly, true-hearted sailor is he.</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s success to the cause that we all of us know;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here’s the good ship <i>Catalpa</i>, and all her ship’s crew;</span>
<span class="i0">Land of felons and jailers, here’s to you adieu,</span>
<span class="i0">From your dry, sandy shores we are speeding away,</span>
<span class="i0">May your fortune be brighter at no distant day;</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s the land of the free, may it flourish and grow,—</span>
<span class="i0">And God prosper old Ireland wherever we go.</span>

<p class="f120"><i>A Song written on the Homeward Voyage,<br />and dedicated to the Crew.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I’m Irish, if you like, and perhaps my name is Mike;</span>
<span class="i0">I’m a land-crab, and but little of a sailor;</span>
<span class="i0">So, for want of better news, now I’ll tell you of a cruise</span>
<span class="i0">I once took on board a simple Yankee whaler.</span>
<span class="i0">From New Bedford she was bound to the Western whaling ground,</span>
<span class="i0">Where they said the whales were always found in plenty;</span>
<span class="i0">So a willing son of toil, in the hope of striking oil,</span>
<span class="i0">I shipped, the greenest hand amongst the twenty.</span>
<span class="i0">Our old barque was staunch and sound, copper-fastened and well found,—</span>
<span class="i0">When I call her old, don’t think that I deride her;</span>
<span class="i0">Catalpa was her name, and when first on board I came,</span>
<span class="i0">I can tell you it was rather “rough on Snyder;”</span>
<span class="i0">For the captain and the mate, they were up both soon and late,</span>
<span class="i0">And around the decks kept hollering and bawling;</span>
<span class="i0">Though I wasn’t very sick, faith I’d rather cut my stick,</span>
<span class="i0">Than those blasted ropes eternally keep hauling.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, if you please, now we’re sitting at our ease,</span>
<span class="i12">Let us moisten up till song flows ripe and mellow;</span>
<span class="i10">Here’s to every honest lass, and together as they pass,</span>
<span class="i12">Here’s a health to every honest, manly fellow!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well we weathered out a gale, when we captured our first whale,</span>
<span class="i0">And a bully hundred-barreller we got;</span>
<span class="i0">May I never die in sin, when it came to cutting-in,</span>
<span class="i0">All hell was there to pay, and no pitch hot;</span>
<span class="i0">For the skipper stamped and tore, and the mates they jumped and swore,</span>
<span class="i0">When they might as well just take it cool and easy;</span>
<span class="i0">And the way the blubber flew round the decks among the crew,</span>
<span class="i0">You’d imagine every man of them was crazy.</span>
<span class="i0">So we cruised the season out where the sperm-whales did spout,</span>
<span class="i0">And I learned what cutting-in and trying-out meant;</span>
<span class="i0">When, on a friendly call, we anchored at Fayal,</span>
<span class="i0">And sent our oil on shore there for transhipment.</span>
<span class="i0">Then we hoisted sail again, bound for the Spanish main,</span>
<span class="i0">Six months upon hard-tack, salt beef and pork.</span>
<span class="i0">Some may like a sailor’s life, but I’d rather have a wife,</span>
<span class="i0">And the humblest little shanty in New York.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle round, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Steering for the river Platte, so the captain and the mate</span>
<span class="i0">Told us, green ones, who inquired where we were going;</span>
<span class="i0">But eastward, day by day, we kept bearing still away,</span>
<span class="i0">And where he meant to stop there was no knowing.</span>
<span class="i0">So the shellbacks then began to growl at the “old man,”</span>
<span class="i0">Steering for the river Platte in such a manner;</span>
<span class="i0">But as little did they know where the skipper meant to go,</span>
<span class="i0">As a puppy dog of etiquette or grammar.</span>
<span class="i0">Well, we sighted land at last, and soon our anchor cast,</span>
<span class="i0">But to name the place, I guess, my friends, would fail ye;</span>
<span class="i0">For the land to which we bore, and where we went ashore,</span>
<span class="i0">Was Bunbury, in Western Australia.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We entered for recruits, wood, water, fish and fruits,</span>
<span class="i0">Spuds, onions, and our liberty on shore;</span>
<span class="i0">In a fortnight, well prepared, scrubbed, painted and repaired,</span>
<span class="i0">We hoisted sail and put to sea once more.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle round, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then the joy began for every Irishman,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose soul indignant spurns at British slavery,</span>
<span class="i0">Who hates the tyrant guile, and the cunning, low and vile,</span>
<span class="i0">That fosters cant, hypocrisy and knavery.</span>
<span class="i0">Six Irish soldiers brave, rescued from the living grave,</span>
<span class="i0">In which the cursed spite of England bound them,</span>
<span class="i0">Life and liberty to save, came flying o’er the wave,</span>
<span class="i0">And along with our bold skipper there we found them.</span>
<span class="i0">Then the British lion roared for his captives; and, on board</span>
<span class="i0">A steamer, sent out soldiery to find them;</span>
<span class="i0">Police and volunteers, great guns and cannoneers,</span>
<span class="i0">To capture, and once more in fetters bind them.</span>
<span class="i0">They followed us all day, and we couldn’t get away,</span>
<span class="i0">For the wind was light, and blowing on the land;</span>
<span class="i0">And we tacked all through the night, till the early morning light</span>
<span class="i0">Showed the steamer coming for us close at hand.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was useless strife to wage, she had got the weather-gage,</span>
<span class="i0">On the wind she couldn’t hope to outsail her;</span>
<span class="i0">So we held upon our course, to see what moral force</span>
<span class="i0">They’d try upon the simple Yankee whaler.</span>
<span class="i0">Then hot in haste and rage, all ready to engage,</span>
<span class="i0">They came like bloodhounds straining at the slip,</span>
<span class="i0">And the boss of all these jailers, to frighten us poor sailors,</span>
<span class="i0">Fired a round shot from his cannon at our ship.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We never cracked a lay, on our course still bore away,</span>
<span class="i0">And he found we wouldn’t scare worth a cent;</span>
<span class="i0">So another dodge he tried, but we knew the beggar lied,</span>
<span class="i0">When he said he’d orders from our government.</span>
<span class="i0">Then like a puffing pig, he strutted very big,</span>
<span class="i0">On his quarter-deck, and loudly gave us warning,</span>
<span class="i0">That he’d blow us to the devil, which wasn’t very civil</span>
<span class="i0">To lads who’d been up early in the morning.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he found us rather fly, alive, quite pert, and spry,</span>
<span class="i0">Cool and ready for this boast, right little caring,</span>
<span class="i0">And our answer soon went back, as upon the starboard tack,</span>
<span class="i0">Right down upon his broadside we came bearing;</span>
<span class="i0">For we knew our cause was just, so in God we put our trust,</span>
<span class="i0">For Liberty, all threats and danger scorning;</span>
<span class="i0">And o’er our heads there flew Freedom’s flag, red, white and blue,</span>
<span class="i0">Streaming gaily in the breeze, our peak adorning.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he hailed us once again, having blustered all in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">With a mild request to let him come on board;</span>
<span class="i0">But our captain answered no; “it would never do for Joe;”</span>
<span class="i0">At sea to stop, he couldn’t well afford.</span>
<span class="i0">So they left us in despair, and skulked off to their lair,</span>
<span class="i0">Whilst our starry flag with joyful hearts we hail her,</span>
<span class="i0">For the lion dropped his tail, and his growl became a wail,</span>
<span class="i0">When bearded by a simple Yankee whaler.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, etc.</span>

<span class="i0">I’m Irish if you like, and perhaps my name is <i>Mike</i>,</span>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
