                           A DESCRIPTIVE POEM
                                 OF THE
                     Rescue of the Fenian Prisoners
                                  FROM
                         FREEMANTLE, AUSTRALIA.


      It was on Easter Monday, in ’Seventy-six,
      In Freemantle the jailers were all in a fix,
      From Fauntleroy,[1] down to Amen-timbertoe,[2]
      There was racing and chasing and bother, you know,
      For the Fenians had sliddered[3] right off in a row;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Oh! Wilson and Cranston and Hogan are gone,
      With Darragh and Hassett and staunch Harrington;
      For Collins and Johnston have opened the ball,
      And to join in the dancing, out step Jones and Hall,
      And they tripped to a tune that was far from being slow;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Cops,[4] warders and soldiers are running a race
      And the mounted policemen prepare to give chase;
      In the pensioner’s barracks the trumpet did blow,
      And old Finnerty’s[5] bugle was purple, I know;
      But the boys know their road, and are bound for to go;
      So what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      There are two trotting teams on the Rockingham road,
      From the gloom of a prison each bearing its load,
      And full hearts are beating with freedom and joy,
      As they sweep ’round the sand hills and through the Blackboy.
      With the sunlight of Hope every face is aglow;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      On, on through the bush, as they ride to the beach,
      In vain for his captives may Robinson[6] screech,
      And Harvest[7] may swagger to cover his fears
      As they drag out the guns of the Perth volunteers;
      But the Fenians are off; they may puff, pant and blow;
      For what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Near Rockingham jetty, upon the white sand,
      With revolvers and rifles the Fenians stand—
      Gay, fearless and free, stepping into their boat;
      Shove her off! then out oars! on the waters afloat!
      Now a right saucy Yankee tar takes them in tow;
      And what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Now Silvee and Toby and Mopsa give way,
      For the good ship _Catalpa_ lies out in the bay.
      “Come down, you big Louis,” the captain did roar,
      “Now what do you say, men? pull off from the shore;
      You Lombar, keep stroke; pull, men, cheerily, oh!”
      And what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Now past Garden Island, and clear off the Sound,
      Make sail on the boat, pass the liquor around;
      Shift your seats, trim the boat, as she bends to the breeze,
      And light as a sea-gull skims over the seas;
      There’s a rest from the oar, while the fair breezes blow;
      And what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      At six in the evening we sighted the bark,
      And we steered on her track till the evening grew dark,
      When a squall coming down, with its venomous blast,
      Almost swamped our good boat, as it tore out her mast;
      So all night on the billows we tossed to and fro;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Next morning at seven we raised her again,
      Topsails, mainsails and hull—we were nearing her plain,
      When we spied the _Georgette_, steaming out of the Sound,
      And we knew by her course for the bark she was bound;
      So we hauled down our sail, then lay to and lay low;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      So the _Georgette_ passed by bearing down on our ship;
      All safe for the present—now, boys, let her rip;
      Then we pulled in her wake for to see what she’d do,
      And beside the _Catalpa_ we saw her heave to,
      And lay alongside her ten minutes or so;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      See the _Georgette_ steams off, and is running inshore;
      Make sail on the boat, out with paddle and oar;
      For with every sail set, on her course down the bay,
      The good ship _Catalpa_ is bearing away.
      To gain on her now we’ve a hard row to hoe;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      To follow our bark we were pulling amain,
      When we saw the _Georgette_ coming for us again.
      In search of our boat she was steaming right back,
      And we almost despaired as we lay in her track;
      So we hauled down our sail and again we lay low;
      And what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Still nearer and nearer the steamer came on,
      And our plan of escape seemed all shattered and gone;
      Hope faded away to a very small speck,
      As we saw her lookout and the men on her deck;
      But she passed us unseen—Fate had ordered it so;
      And what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      So the steamer passed on, and was soon out of sight;
      Boys, now for the bark, we must catch her ere night;
      Every stroke is for freedom—pull fast, and pull strong—
      Pull, fellows, together and send her along;
      See the bark change her course, heading for us I trow;
      And what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      It was two in the evening, and everything clear,
      The bark coming to us, and nothing to fear,
      When a sail on our lee, standing out from the shore,
      Set us pulling our strongest with paddle and oar;
      It’s a race for the ship, men; then row, bullies, row!
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      With the sail on our lee, heading on for the ship,
      We pulled strong and steady, and gave her the slip;
      For beside the _Catalpa_ we tossed oars at three,
      With the water-police boat close up on her lee.
      Quick on deck now, my lads! It was just “touch and go;”
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Hoist the star-spangled banner, the flag of the free!
      The brightest and best that waves over the sea:
      May its stars ever brighten, its shadow increase,
      Then a fig for John Bull and his water-police.
      Wear ship! then for sea, blow you fair breezes, blow!
      And what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Here’s a health to brave Anthony, pass it along,
      May his fortune be great, and his name live in song;
      Here’s to Smith, our first-mate, fill your glasses with glee,
      For a right manly, true-hearted sailor is he.
      Here’s success to the cause that we all of us know;
      But what’s that to any one, whether or no?

      Here’s the good ship _Catalpa_, and all her ship’s crew;
      Land of felons and jailers, here’s to you adieu,
      From your dry, sandy shores we are speeding away,
      May your fortune be brighter at no distant day;
      Here’s the land of the free, may it flourish and grow,—
      And God prosper old Ireland wherever we go.

Rolling Home.


[The following is one of his latest literary efforts,—which was
often sung by the ship’s company,—a song entitled “Rolling Home,”
which eminently proves that he is possessed of as much poetic fire
and genius, as he is of tact and ability to carry out great political
undertakings.]

      Right across the Indian Ocean, while the trade-wind follows fast,
      Speeds our ship with gentle motion; fear and chains behind us
          cast.
      Rolling home! rolling home! rolling home across the sea;
      Rolling home to bright Columbia; home to friends and Liberty.

      Through the waters blue and bright, through dark wave and hissing
          foam,
      Ever onward, with delight, we are sailing still for home;
      O’er our pathway in the sunshine flies the wide-winged albatross;
      O’er our topmast in the moonlight hangs the starry southern cross.
                        Rolling home, etc., etc.

      By the stormy Cape now flying, with a full and flowing sail;
      See! the daylight ’round us dying on the black breast of the gale;
      See! the lightning flash above us, and the dark surge roll below;
      Here’s a health to those who love us, here’s defiance to the foe.
                        Rolling home, etc., etc.

      Now the wide Atlantic cleaving, with our good ship speeding free,
      The dull “Cape of storms” we’re leaving far to eastward on our
          lee;
      And as homeward through the waters on the old _Catalpa_ goes,
      Ho! you fellows on the masthead, let us hear once more, “He
          blows!”
                      Rolling home, etc., etc.

      Next by lonely St. Helena, with a steady wind we glide,
      By the rock-built, sea-girt prison where the gallant Frenchman
          died;
      With the flying-fish and porpoise sporting round us in the wave,
      With the stars and stripes of freedom floating o’er us bright and
          brave.
                      Rolling home, etc., etc.

      Past “the Line!” and now the Dipper[8] hangs glittering in the
          sky,
      Onward still! in the blue water see the Gulf-weed[9] passing by.
      Homeward! homeward to Columbia! blow you steady breezes, blow;
      Till we hear it from the masthead, the joyful cry, “Land, ho!”
                      Rolling home, etc., etc.

[8] American sailors called Ursa Major the Dipper.

[9] Meeting the Gulf-weed out at sea encouraged Columbus and his
sailors to continue on their course, it being considered an indication
of land.




The Cruise of the Catalpa.


_A Song written on the Homeward Voyage, and dedicated to the Crew._

      I’m Irish, if you like, and perhaps my name is Mike;
      I’m a land-crab, and but little of a sailor;
      So, for want of better news, now I’ll tell you of a cruise
      I once took on board a simple Yankee whaler.
      From New Bedford she was bound to the Western whaling ground,
      Where they said the whales were always found in plenty;
      So a willing son of toil, in the hope of striking oil,
      I shipped, the greenest hand amongst the twenty.
      Our old barque was staunch and sound, copper-fastened and well
          found,—
      When I call her old, don’t think that I deride her;
      Catalpa was her name, and when first on board I came,
      I can tell you it was rather “rough on Snyder;”
      For the captain and the mate, they were up both soon and late,
      And around the decks kept hollering and bawling;
      Though I wasn’t very sick, faith I’d rather cut my stick,
      Than those blasted ropes eternally keep hauling.

      _Chorus._—Pass the bottle, if you please, now we’re sitting
                           at our ease,
                        Let us moisten up till song flows ripe and
                             mellow;
                      Here’s to every honest lass, and together as they
                           pass,
                        Here’s a health to every honest, manly fellow!

      Well we weathered out a gale, when we captured our first whale,
      And a bully hundred-barreller we got;
      May I never die in sin, when it came to cutting-in,
      All hell was there to pay, and no pitch hot;
      For the skipper stamped and tore, and the mates they jumped and
          swore,
      When they might as well just take it cool and easy;
      And the way the blubber flew round the decks among the crew,
      You’d imagine every man of them was crazy.
      So we cruised the season out where the sperm-whales did spout,
      And I learned what cutting-in and trying-out meant;
      When, on a friendly call, we anchored at Fayal,
      And sent our oil on shore there for transhipment.
      Then we hoisted sail again, bound for the Spanish main,
      Six months upon hard-tack, salt beef and pork.
      Some may like a sailor’s life, but I’d rather have a wife,
      And the humblest little shanty in New York.
                      _Chorus._—Pass the bottle round, etc.

      Steering for the river Platte, so the captain and the mate
      Told us, green ones, who inquired where we were going;
      But eastward, day by day, we kept bearing still away,
      And where he meant to stop there was no knowing.
      So the shellbacks then began to growl at the “old man,”
      Steering for the river Platte in such a manner;
      But as little did they know where the skipper meant to go,
      As a puppy dog of etiquette or grammar.
      Well, we sighted land at last, and soon our anchor cast,
      But to name the place, I guess, my friends, would fail ye;
      For the land to which we bore, and where we went ashore,
      Was Bunbury, in Western Australia.
      We entered for recruits, wood, water, fish and fruits,
      Spuds, onions, and our liberty on shore;
      In a fortnight, well prepared, scrubbed, painted and repaired,
      We hoisted sail and put to sea once more.
                      _Chorus._—Pass the bottle round, etc.

      And then the joy began for every Irishman,
      Whose soul indignant spurns at British slavery,
      Who hates the tyrant guile, and the cunning, low and vile,
      That fosters cant, hypocrisy and knavery.
      Six Irish soldiers brave, rescued from the living grave,
      In which the cursed spite of England bound them,
      Life and liberty to save, came flying o’er the wave,
      And along with our bold skipper there we found them.
      Then the British lion roared for his captives; and, on board
      A steamer, sent out soldiery to find them;
      Police and volunteers, great guns and cannoneers,
      To capture, and once more in fetters bind them.
      They followed us all day, and we couldn’t get away,
      For the wind was light, and blowing on the land;
      And we tacked all through the night, till the early morning light
      Showed the steamer coming for us close at hand.
                      _Chorus._—Pass the bottle, etc.

      It was useless strife to wage, she had got the weather-gage,
      On the wind she couldn’t hope to outsail her;
      So we held upon our course, to see what moral force
      They’d try upon the simple Yankee whaler.
      Then hot in haste and rage, all ready to engage,
      They came like bloodhounds straining at the slip,
      And the boss of all these jailers, to frighten us poor sailors,
      Fired a round shot from his cannon at our ship.
      We never cracked a lay, on our course still bore away,
      And he found we wouldn’t scare worth a cent;
      So another dodge he tried, but we knew the beggar lied,
      When he said he’d orders from our government.
      Then like a puffing pig, he strutted very big,
      On his quarter-deck, and loudly gave us warning,
      That he’d blow us to the devil, which wasn’t very civil
      To lads who’d been up early in the morning.
                      _Chorus._—Pass the bottle, etc.

      But he found us rather fly, alive, quite pert, and spry,
      Cool and ready for this boast, right little caring,
      And our answer soon went back, as upon the starboard tack,
      Right down upon his broadside we came bearing;
      For we knew our cause was just, so in God we put our trust,
      For Liberty, all threats and danger scorning;
      And o’er our heads there flew Freedom’s flag, red, white and blue,
      Streaming gaily in the breeze, our peak adorning.
      Then he hailed us once again, having blustered all in vain,
      With a mild request to let him come on board;
      But our captain answered no; “it would never do for Joe;”
      At sea to stop, he couldn’t well afford.
      So they left us in despair, and skulked off to their lair,
      Whilst our starry flag with joyful hearts we hail her,
      For the lion dropped his tail, and his growl became a wail,
      When bearded by a simple Yankee whaler.
                      _Chorus._—Pass the bottle, etc.

      I’m Irish if you like, and perhaps my name is _Mike_,
      I’m a land-crab, and but little of a sailor;
      From the Western whaling ground, all safe and homeward bound,
      On board a little, saucy Yankee whaler.
      You may say I’ve lots of cheek, aye, and maybe call me _Greek_,
      Though I never knew Omega yet from Alpha;
      But I’ve sailed the world around, on the goose you’ll find I’m
          sound,
      And I’ve cruised aboard the gallant old _Catalpa_.
      Pass the bottle, if you please, now we’re sitting at our ease,
      Let us moisten up till song flows ripe and mellow;
      Here’s to every honest lass, and as on through life they pass,
      Here’s a health to every honest, manly fellow.




The Sunburst and Tricolor.


[_Written previous to sailing for Australia, and dedicated to the
“U.I.B.”_]

      AIR.—_Down, down in our village._

      Comrades, around, come let us sing,
        The Sunburst and the Tricolor;
      Our hearts’ affections ’round them cling,
        With hope and pride for evermore.
      Now first to _thee_ our fathers raised,
        Proud standard of the mighty dead!
      Whose golden glory flashed and blazed
        In triumph, o’er their victor tread.
              The Green! the Green!
              With emerald sheen,
      Though Time hath tarnished many a fold;
              The blood and tears,
              And dust of years,
      ’Twill cast them off when once unrolled.
              Our own old flag,
              Our dear old flag,
              Our native Green!
              Our own dear flag,
              ’Twill wave again,
              O’er earth and main,
              Our native Green!
              Our Sunburst flag.

      Hurrah! ’tis freedom’s earliest dawn,
        Bright streamers flash the cloudy skies;
      Out from the night of slavery drawn,
        Behold our Tricolor arise!
      The emblem of a patriot’s love,
        The symbol of a Nation’s faith,
      We swear each fold that floats above,
        To hold and guard it until death.
                Soon may we see
                Amongst the free
      Our Tricolor, a standard brave!
                Green, white and gold,
                Proudly unrolled,
      Triumphant over Ireland wave!
                Our own young flag,
                Our dear young flag,
                  Our Tricolor.
                Our brave young flag,
                  Long torn and tried;
                Now side by side,
                  True hearts uphold,
                Our brave young flag.

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
